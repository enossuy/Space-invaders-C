# SPACE INVADERS 

In this project, I tried to recreate a replica of the famous game "Space Invaders" using only C programming language and SDL GUI.


The game starts with 3 rows of invaders, each row contains 12 invader. They are trying to attack your ship, so watch out !


You can control your ship using 'h' key for right movement, 'g' key for left movement and 'r' key for shooting.


Note that your ship will maintain its movement if the key is still pressed, same for shooting. 


Invaders die upon a collision with a missile, their bombs too. Yeah, they drop bombs ^_^





++++++++++++++Bugs++++++++++++

shields don't disappear when colliding with bombs / missiles / invaders

ship doesn't die 

no game over status
